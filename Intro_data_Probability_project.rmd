## Setup

### Load packages

```{r load-packages, message = FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)
```

### Load data

Make sure your data and R Markdown files are in the same directory. When loaded
your data file will be called `brfss2013`. Delete this note when before you submit 
your work. 

```{r load-data}
load("brfss2013.RData")

## Part 2: Research questions

**Research quesion 1:**

Is working out in the past 30 days is associated with the frequency of a person being nerouvs during previous month difference between men and femail?


```{r}

#preparing the data
Nervous_sex_exercise <- brfss2013 %>% select(sex,exerany2, misnervs)

Nervous_sex_exercise <- Nervous_sex_exercise %>% filter(!is.na(misnervs),!is.na(sex))

#summarise by sex(how many males and femails in the prepared set)

Nervous_sex_exercise_Sex_prop <- Nervous_sex_exercise %>% group_by(sex) %>% summarise(count= n()) %>% mutate(perc=count/sum(count))

Nervous_sex_exercise_Sex_prop

#percentages of people in groups of 

Nervous_sex_exercise <- Nervous_sex_exercise %>% group_by(misnervs,sex) %>% summarise(count= n())  %>% mutate(perc=count/sum(count)) 

#stacked barchart for number of people for different sexes being nervious a particular proportion of the past 30 days

Nervous_sex_exercise_plot <- ggplot(Nervous_sex_exercise, aes(x=misnervs, y=perc, fill= sex ))+geom_bar(stat="identity")

Nervous_sex_exercise_plot + geom_hline(yintercept=0.59)



Nervous_sex_exercise <- Nervous_sex_exercise %>% mutate(diff_from_Marginal=ifelse(sex=="Male",Nervous_sex_exercise_Sex_prop$perc[1],Nervous_sex_exercise_Sex_prop$perc[2]	)-perc)


ggplot(Nervous_sex_exercise, aes(fill=sex, y=diff_from_Marginal, x=misnervs)) + geom_bar(position="dodge", stat="identity")

##ggplot replace count with percentage in geom_barâ†’https://stackoverflow.com/questions/24776200/ggplot-replace-count-with-percentage-in-geom-bar/48602277

 
#QUESTION: How do I construct an experiment which will help me answer the question about "Are Men having in general more stresfull life than women". From what I know I would need to choose a random group of people and assign "sex" randomly to each of the participants, and then I will see what happens. But you can't change sexes of your participants. So what should I do?
```

It looks like in US men are more likely to have a nervious day then women.

**Research quesion 2:**

Is working out in the past 30 days is associated with number of days you mentaly feal not good and what is the difference between men and femail?
